Our main robot for performing initial proof-of-concept runs using actual
hardware is the Turtlebot.  It is, perhaps, one of the more widely
deployed wheeled, autonomous robot configurations around today, for
indoor scenarios.  Think of the Knightscope robot, Fetch, ..., though
Boston Dynamics is making an effort to change that (as is Anybotics).
To test out different hardware configurations, we have several that are
instrumented in different ways.  With stereo cameras, with depth
sensors, with different compute platforms, from an Odroid Xu4, 
an Jetson TX2, and an Intel Celeron laptop, to an Intel i7 6th
generation laptop.

Courtesy of a Facebook donation, we have a more instrumented version
called the PyRobot (Locobot),

Not used as much, but available is also a custom built quadcopter,

We are also working on building several other wheeled robots, more in
the RC car vein and other types of commonly used wheeled vehicles.
Eventually, you will be able to see what our robots have achieved on this
