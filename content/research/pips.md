**Abstract:** Explores the use of perception-space, e.g., a visual
representation space, for collision checking during navigation through
an unknown environment.  Employing the Marr's concept of the 2.5D
representation, the collision checking approach speeds up the time to
collision-checking to permit low latency or real-time navigation on
limited compute hardware, as well as high performance hardware.
