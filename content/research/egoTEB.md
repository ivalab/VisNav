**Abstract:** Our second attempt at integrating the PiPS concept with
a local-global navigation scheme.  This time we used Timed Elastic
Bands (TEB) as the base local planner. Modifying TEB using our
egocentric approach leads to egoTEB.
A world, grid-based approach has a computational cost that scales with
the area of the local grid, whereas the egocircle approach scales with
the boundaries.  Thus rather than scale quadratically, it scales
linearly with regards to the sensing footprint.
