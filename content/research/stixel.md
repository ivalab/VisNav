**Abstract:** Stixels are an intermediate stereo representation for the
world. The basic version models the world as sticks rising from the
ground plane, which makes it a potentially lossy representation
(overhanging or floating obstacles might be missed). As an intermediate
representation, it can be used for ego-centric navigation.
