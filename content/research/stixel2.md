**Abstract:** Our second attempt at using stixels for navigation and
exploring its computational properties. This time we integrate with
our _egocircle_ representation and explore two different approaches to
realizing local-global navigation. Computational scaling and
navigation benchmark tests indicate that stixel navigation can be used
across a variety of onboard computing platforms for mobile robots.

More details will be forthcoming.[^1]
